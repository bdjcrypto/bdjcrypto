- 👋 Hi, I’m Brian
- 👀 I’m interested in contributing to projects to lend a helping hand while gaining experience. I would like to eventually get hired as a developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of many different languages via Sololearn (Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript), but I am focusing on learning Python more in depth.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that help me learn different implementations of the things I am learning through courses.
- 📫 You can reach me at bdjcrypto@protonmail.com
